0x05. Python - Exceptions
This project focuses on the topic of exceptions in Python programming. The main objective is to understand the concepts of errors and exceptions, learn how to use exceptions to handle errors, and explore various aspects related to exception handling.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:

Explain the reasons why Python programming is considered awesome.
Differentiate between errors and exceptions.
Understand what exceptions are and how to use them effectively.
Identify scenarios where exceptions are needed.
Demonstrate proper exception handling techniques.
Comprehend the purpose of catching exceptions.
Raise built-in exceptions when necessary.
Implement clean-up actions after an exception is raised.
Project Tasks
This project consists of several tasks that cover different aspects of exception handling. Here is a brief overview of each task:

Safe list printing: Implement a function that prints a specified number of elements from a list, ensuring proper exception handling and error checking.

Safe printing of an integers list: Create a function that prints an integer with proper exception handling, using the "{:d}".format() format.

Print and count integers: Develop a function that prints the first x elements of a list and counts the number of integers printed, while skipping other non-integer values.

Integers division with debug: Write a function that divides two integers and prints the result, handling division by zero and displaying the result in the finally section.

Divide a list: Implement a function that divides element by element from two lists, handling various exceptions such as division by zero, wrong types, and out-of-range access.

Raise exception: Create a function that raises a type exception without importing any modules.

Raise a message: Develop a function that raises a name exception with a specified message, without importing any modules.
