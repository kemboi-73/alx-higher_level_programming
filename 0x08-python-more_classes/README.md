# Project 0x08 - Python: More Classes and Objects

## Description
This project focuses on object-oriented programming in Python, specifically on the concept of classes and objects. It covers topics such as attributes, methods, initialization, data abstraction, data encapsulation, information hiding, properties, class methods, static methods, and more.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without using external resources:

- The awesomeness of Python programming
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- "First-class everything"
- Class and object instances
- The difference between a class and an object or instance
- Attributes and how to use public, protected, and private attributes
- The purpose of `self` in Python
- Methods in Python and how to define and use them
- The special `__init__` method and its usage
- Data abstraction, data encapsulation, and information hiding
- Properties and their difference from attributes in Python
- The Pythonic way to write getters and setters
- The `__str__` and `__repr__` methods and how to use them
- The difference between `__str__` and `__repr__`
- Class attributes and object attributes
- The difference between a class attribute and an object attribute
- Class methods and static methods
- Dynamically creating arbitrary new attributes for existing instances
- Binding attributes to objects and classes
- The purpose of `__dict__` in a class and an instance
- How Python finds attributes of an object or class
- How to use the `getattr` function

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.\*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Files
The project consists of the following files:

- `0-rectangle.py`: Defines an empty class `Rectangle`.
- `1-rectangle.py`: Defines a class `Rectangle` with private instance attributes `width` and `height`.
- `2-rectangle.py`: Adds public instance methods `area` and `perimeter` to the `Rectangle` class.
- `3-rectangle.py`: Overrides the `__str__` method to return a string representation of the rectangle using the character `#`.
- `4-rectangle.py`: Overrides the `__repr__` method to return a string representation of the rectangle that can be used with `eval()` to create a new instance.
- `5-rectangle.py`: Adds a message when an instance of the `Rectangle` class is deleted.
