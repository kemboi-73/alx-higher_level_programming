# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

## Description
This repository contains solutions for various tasks related to the concept of objects in Python. The tasks aim to deepen the understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python and explore the behavior of different types of objects.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the principles of object-oriented programming in Python
- Differentiate between classes, objects, and instances
- Distinguish between mutable and immutable objects
- Explore references, assignments, and aliases
- Identify identical and linked variables
- Display variable identifiers (memory addresses)
- Recognize built-in mutable and immutable types
- Understand variable passing to functions

## Files
The following files are present in this repository:

### Answer Files
Answer files are text files that contain the answers to specific questions asked in the tasks.
